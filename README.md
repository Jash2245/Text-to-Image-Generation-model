**Text-to-Image Generation Application using Stable Diffusion**

This repository contains a text-to-image generation application developed during my internship at BrainWave Matrix Solutions. The project utilizes the Stable Diffusion model to transform textual descriptions into corresponding visual representations, leveraging advanced generative AI techniques.

Project Overview

The primary goal of this project is to explore the capabilities of Stable Diffusion in generating high-quality images from text prompts. The application is built using PyTorch and the Hugging Face diffusers library, optimized for both CPU and GPU environments to deliver an efficient and scalable solution.

Key Features

Generative AI: Uses state-of-the-art Stable Diffusion technology to create detailed and realistic images from text.
Scalable Performance: Optimized to run on different hardware configurations, including CPU and GPU, for diverse computational needs.
Extensive Flexibility: Capable of generating images based on a wide range of textual descriptions to cater to various user needs.
Technologies Used

Python: The core programming language for building the application.
PyTorch: Utilized for handling deep learning operations and model implementations.
Hugging Face diffusers: A framework that provides pre-trained generative models like Stable Diffusion, simplifying the development process.
